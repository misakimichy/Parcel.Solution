# Parcels

#### _C#, .NET: Job Board, 01/07/2020_
Create a website for a fictional shipping company that helps users calculate shipping estimates.

## Description
Create a website where the user can submit a form with the dimensions(width, height and length) and weight of a parcel, and display the cost to ship and the volume of a parcel with its dimensions in your site.

## Application should have:
- has `Parcel` class: It should contain a constructor, and getters and setters for each property. You should be able to create a new parcel and specify the dimensions and weight in the arguments.

- can take user input and use the data in the form to instantiate a `Parcel` object and display its dimensions and weight.

- When you call a method called `Volume()` on a `Parcel` instance, it should return the product of the sides.

- When you call a `CostToShip()` method on your parcel, return a cost based on a formula you make up.

- Display the cost to ship and the volume of a Parcel with its dimensions in your site.

- Returns an error message if any of the form fields are blank. Display an error message instead.

- User can only enter numbers into the form.
